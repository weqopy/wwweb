<html><body><table><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)</td><td>Python (programming language)</td><td>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.[23][24] The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.[25]</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_routing_platforms</td><td>List of open-source routing platforms</td><td>Open-source routing platforms may refer to:</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Python_web_frameworks</td><td>Category:Python web frameworks</td><td>A web framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications, web services and web APIs. The framework aims to alleviate the overhead associated with common activities used in web development. For example, many frameworks provide libraries for database access, template processing and session management, and often promote code reuse. Though they often target development of dynamic websites they are also applicable to static websites.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Community_portal</td><td>Wikipedia:Community portal</td><td>This page provides a listing of current collaborations, tasks, and news about English Wikipedia.

Since Wikipedia is an "encyclopedia anyone can edit", it can be abused to create hoaxes.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Don%27t_come_down_like_a_ton_of_bricks</td><td>Wikipedia:Don't come down like a ton of bricks</td><td>Wikipedia has a lot of policies and guidelines. They have evolved from the early days, due to consensus. For instance, we decided early on that Albert Einstein would be a good subject for a Wikipedia article, but The weather in London wouldn'tâ€”but what about in between? We decided to call this notability, and years of experience have allowed us to judge that, in the absence of anything else, coverage in reliable sources is a good "one size fits all" method of doing so. More specific guidelines, such as those to do with biographies of living people, resulted from something that required the guideline to be made. A huge list of policies and guidelines have been created to solve various problems, and remembering every single one of them is impossible.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows</td><td>Microsoft Windows</td><td>Microsoft Windows, or simply Windows, is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT and Windows Embedded; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses</td><td>Comparison of free and open-source software licenses</td><td>This is a comparison of published free software licenses and open-source licenses.
