<html><body><table><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)</td><td>Python (programming language)</td><td>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.[23][24] The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.[25]</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop#Python</td><td>While loop</td><td>In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser</td><td>Web browser</td><td>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) that may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content.[1] Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition</td><td>The Free Software Definition</td><td>The Free Software Definition written by Richard Stallman and published by Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as being software that ensures that the end users have freedom in using, studying, sharing and modifying that software. The term "free" is used in the sense of "free speech," not of "free of charge."[1] The earliest known publication of the definition was in the February 1986 edition[2] of the now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin publication of FSF. The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. As of April 2008[update], it is published there in 39 languages.[3] FSF publishes a list of licences which meet this definition.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)</td><td>Lock (computer science)</td><td>In computer science, a lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many threads of execution. A lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy</td><td>NumPy</td><td>NumPy (pronounced /ˈnʌmpaɪ/ (NUM-py) or sometimes /ˈnʌmpi/[1][2] (NUM-pee)) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)</td><td>Fedora (operating system)</td><td>Fedora /fɪˈdɒr.ə/ (formerly Fedora Core) is an Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel and GNU programs (a Linux distribution), developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by the Red Hat company.[5] Fedora contains software distributed under various free and open-source licenses and aims to be on the leading edge of such technologies.[6][7][8] Fedora is the upstream source of the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution.[9]</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn2Own</td><td>Pwn2Own</td><td>Pwn2Own is a computer hacking contest held annually at the CanSecWest security conference, beginning in 2007.[1] Contestants are challenged to exploit widely used software and mobile devices with previously unknown vulnerabilities. Winners of the contest receive the device that they exploited, a cash prize, and a "Masters" jacket celebrating the year of their win. The name "Pwn2Own" is derived from the fact that contestants must "pwn" or hack the device in order to "own" or win it. The Pwn2Own contest serves to demonstrate the vulnerability of devices and software in widespread use while also providing a checkpoint on the progress made in security since the previous year.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LWN.net</td><td>LWN.net</td><td>LWN.net is a computing webzine with an emphasis on free software and software for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It consists of a weekly issue, separate stories which are published most days, and threaded discussion attached to every story. Most news published daily are short summaries of articles published elsewhere, and are free to all viewers. Original articles are usually published weekly on Thursdays and are available only to subscribers for one week, after which they become free as well. LWN.net is part of Eklektix, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origyn_Web_Browser</td><td>Origyn Web Browser</td><td>Origyn Web Browser (OWB) is a discontinued web browser that was synchronized with WebKit and sponsored by the technology company Pleyo. OWB provides a meta-port to an abstract platform with the aim of making porting to embedded or lightweight systems faster and easier.[5][6] This port is used for embedded devices such as set-top boxes, and other consumer electronics.[7][8][9]</td></tr></table></body></title>
