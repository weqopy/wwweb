<html><body><table><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)</td><td>Python (programming language)</td><td>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.[23][24] The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.[25]</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform</td><td>Cross-platform</td><td>In computing, cross-platform software (also multi-platform software or platform-independent software) is computer software that is implemented on multiple computing platforms.[1] Cross-platform software may be divided into two types; one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports, and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation, e.g., software written in an interpreted language or pre-compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all platforms.[2]</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre</td><td>Gratis versus libre</td><td>The English adjective free is commonly used in one of two meanings: "for zero price" (gratis) and "with little or no restriction" (libre). This ambiguity of free can cause issues where the distinction is important, as it often is in dealing with laws concerning the use of information, such as copyright and patents.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_build</td><td>Software build</td><td>In the field of software development, the term build is similar to that of any other field. That is, the construction of something that has an observable and tangible result.[1] Historically, build has often referred either to the process of converting source code files into standalone software artifact(s) that can be run on a computer, or the result of doing so. However, this is not the case with technologies such as Perl, Ruby or Python which are examples of interpreted languages.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administration</td><td>System administrator</td><td>A system administrator, or sysadmin, is a person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems; especially multi-user computers, such as servers, uptime, performance, resources, and security of the computers he or she manages meet the needs of the users, without exceeding the budget.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)</td><td>Fork (software development)</td><td>In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community, a form of schism.[1]</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system</td><td>Operating system</td><td>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_restriction</td><td>Hardware restriction</td><td>A hardware restriction (sometimes called hardware DRM)[1] is content protection enforced by electronic components. The hardware restriction scheme may complement a digital rights management system implemented in software. Some examples of hardware restriction information appliances are video game consoles, smart phones,[2] tablet computers, Macintosh computers[3] and personal computers that implement secure boot.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System</td><td>Domain Name System</td><td>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality on the Internet, that has been in use since 1985.</td></tr><tr><td>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB</td><td>Live USB</td><td>A live USB is a USB flash drive or external hard disk drive containing a full operating system that can be booted. Although they are closely related to live CDs in that they can be used in embedded systems for system administration, data recovery, or test driving, live USBs can persistently save settings and install software packages on the USB device. Many operating systems including Mac OS 9, macOS, Windows XP Embedded and a large portion of Linux and BSD distributions can run from a USB flash drive, and Windows 8 Enterprise has a feature titled Windows To Go for a similar purpose.</td></tr></table></body></title>
